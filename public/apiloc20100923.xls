At a later stage, the Ag appears also to infiltrate the spaces between the pseudocytomeres of the developing schizonts, as the plasmalemma forms deep invaginations into the parasite cytoplasm (Fig. 3c), and is subsequently seen localized around the cytomeres, just before the individualization of merozoites (Fig. 34.

At a later stage, the Ag appears also to infiltrate the spaces between the pseudocytomeres of the developing schizonts, as the plasmalemma forms deep invaginations into the parasite cytoplasm (Fig. 3c), and is subsequently seen localized around the cytomeres, just before the individualization of merozoites (Fig. 34. The ultrastructural localization of LSA-1 was revealed by immunogold labeling of fully mature forms, which showed this protein to be associated with the fluffy or flocculent material present in the PV that surrounds the emerging exo-erythrocytic merozoites (Fig. 3e).

No staining was found in the rhoptry bulbs or any other organelle of the merozoites.#Supplementary table 6#Sera against the rhoptry neck protein,PfAARP, were used to confirm localization of PfASP in rhoptry neck. PfASP co-localized with PfAARP at the apical ends of merozoites (Fig. 2C). "

(b, red).#As PfSec12 did not appear to be distributed uniformly throughout the ER in all parasites, we compared the pattern of PfSec12 with that of GFPSDEL, which localizes throughout the general ER. GFPSDEL is targeted to the ER by virtue of a signal peptide that directs translocation into the ER lumen and a C-terminal SDEL motif that mediates retrieval from the Golgi, resulting in colocalization with the ER chaperone BiP (van Dooren etal., 2005).##They also show decreased transport of resident fv enzyme PfPlasmepsin I, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker PfBiP, and parasite-associated HRPII to fvs.#The staining pattern of HA-PfROM1 is distinct from endoplasmic reticulum (anti-Bip, Ig binding protein of the ER; Fig. 3 B) and Golgi (anti-PfERD2, ER lumen protein retaining receptor 2, a cis-Golgi marker; Fig. 3 C). #Coverslips were incubated simultaneously with affinity-purified anti-PfGatp antibodies (diluted 1:10) and either mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) to the red blood cell Band 3 protein (diluted 1:500) or rat polyclonal antibodies (MR4) to the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP (32) at 37 C with gentle shaking for 1 h.#Immuno-gold electron microscopy with cultured parasites revealed nuclear location of Pfhsp and primarily cytoplasmic (probably endoplasmic reticulum) location of Pfgrp#To ascertain RAMA trafficking through the compartments of the secretory pathway, we performed double staining IFA using mouse anti-RAMA-E sera and rabbit antibodies to either ER marker (PfGRP) or Golgi marker (PfERD2) proteins.#To localize PfSP21, we performed co-localization studies with ER marker BiP [30 and [44.#Merged images of PfDYN2 (green) and the ER PfBIP (red, df), the apicoplast PfACP (red, gi) and the Golgi apparatus PfERD2 (red, jl).#The cellular localization of Pfdyn1 was compared with the known ER-resident protein, PfGRP, with a rat polyclonal anti-PfGRP antibody to identify the endoplasmic reticular structure inside the parasite cytoplasm#Nup100 localizes in close proximity to BiP, a marker for the ER (Kumar et al., 1991) and does not overlap with DAPI confirming that it defines the outer limits of the nucleus (Fig. 2B).#Extensive colocalization of PM V and BiP was observed (Fig. 5C). In contrast, PM V did not colocalize with the Golgi marker ERD2 (Fig. 5D), which is distributed in small, juxtanuclear foci as previously described#Next, we examined the distribution of PfPRL relative to the ER marker PfBip, and the rhoptry/micronemal protein PfAMA-1.#PfSyn1 (green) again has a peripheral location that is distinct from the ER marker PfBiP (in red) (C). #To confirm that PfCEN3 localizes to centrosomes in the nuclear membrane, parasite ER/nuclear membrane was stained with anti-BiP antibody, which labels an ER resident protein.#Colocalization of Sec13p–GFP (green) with the ER marker BiP (red) in fixed parasites#PfCDS-N3TM–GFP was co-labeled with Bip, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).#Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy analyses of transgenic parasites harboring GFP or HA-tagged PfNT2 demonstrated endoplasmic reticulum localization.

CDPK1 and MSP1 colocalize entirely.#PfPKB exhibited a diffused staining pattern in segmented schizonts, indicating its presence in the cytoplasm, and also exhibited some co-localization with MSP1 (Fig. 6F). In free merozoites PfPKB seems to be localized at the apical end (Fig. 6G), a region that is important for erythrocyte invasion. PfPKB also co-localizes with EBA175, a micronemal protein (data not shown).#(F) Co-localization studies of GFP fusion proteins with the surface marker MSP-1 by immunofluorescence#Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) showed that PTEX150 and HSP101 co-localize and are found in discrete foci in the membranes surrounding the ring-stage parasite (Fig. 1d). This membrane is the PVM, as fluorescence surrounds the parasite membrane marker MSP1(19). #Localization of MSP-119 expressed by the D10-PcM19 transfected parasites by IFA indicates the MSP1 miniprotein colocalizes with the endogenous MSP-1 protein on the plasma membrane.##To further characterize the protein expression patterns and localization of PfMRP in different developmental stages, we performed immunofluorescent assay using antibodies against PfMRP, PfMSP-1 (a protein on merozoite plasma membrane), PfCRT (on food vacuole membrane), and PfMDV-1 (gametocyte-specific).#The 19-kDa C-terminal fragment of PfMSP-1, PfMSP-119, remains membrane-bound on the invading merozoite (Blackman et al. 1990)#PF10_0348-GFP co-localized with the surface protein MSP-1 (red) in fixed parasites (g)"

There was positive staining with GRA1 (Fig. 5b) GRA3 (Fig. 5d), GRA5 (Fig. 5f), GRA6 (Fig. 5g) and GRA7 (Fig. 5h) and reduced staining with GRA2 (Fig. 5c), GRA4 (Fig. 5e), GRA8 (Fig. 5i) and NTPase (Fig. 5j).#Table 1 … Table 2 … The GRA7 staining of the PV was strong during early development (Fig. 3c) and was reduced in the later stages where strong staining was limited to the dense granules in the apical cytoplasm of the merozoites in mature schizonts (Fig. 9c). … Using double labelling, it was possible to show that NTPase was located in granules separated from the rhoptries (Fig. 9f) and that the GRA7 and NTPase were co-localised in these granules (Fig. 9g)."

This enzyme was previously localized to the acidocalcisomes (Rodrigues et al., 2000) and vesicles labeled with the antibody are observed in all preparations with both antibodies (see Fig. S1A, arrows).#Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that, in addition to being located in cytoplasmic vacuoles, the vacuolar (V)-H+-ATPase of T. gondii tachyzoites is also located in the plasma membrane. Surface localization of the V-H+-ATPase was confirmed by experiments using biotinylation of cell surface proteins and immunoprecipitation with antibodies against V-H+-ATPases.#Immunofluorescence microscopy, using antisera raised against conserved peptide sequences of a plant vacuolar pyrophosphatase, suggested that the pyrophosphatase in T. gondii tachyzoites was located in the plasma membrane and intracellular vacuoles of the parasite.#We were not able to colocalize DrpB with markers of the secretory pathway, such as the cis-medial Golgi marker GRASP-RFP [20], the trans-Golgi marker UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase T1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) (TgGalNac-YFP; M.
