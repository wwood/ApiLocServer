(b, red).#As PfSec12 did not appear to be distributed uniformly throughout the ER in all parasites, we compared the pattern of PfSec12 with that of GFPSDEL, which localizes throughout the general ER. GFPSDEL is targeted to the ER by virtue of a signal peptide that directs translocation into the ER lumen and a C-terminal SDEL motif that mediates retrieval from the Golgi, resulting in colocalization with the ER chaperone BiP (van Dooren etal., 2005).##They also show decreased transport of resident fv enzyme PfPlasmepsin I, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker PfBiP, and parasite-associated HRPII to fvs.#The staining pattern of HA-PfROM1 is distinct from endoplasmic reticulum (anti-Bip, Ig binding protein of the ER; Fig. 3 B) and Golgi (anti-PfERD2, ER lumen protein retaining receptor 2, a cis-Golgi marker; Fig. 3 C). #Coverslips were incubated simultaneously with affinity-purified anti-PfGatp antibodies (diluted 1:10) and either mouse monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) to the red blood cell Band 3 protein (diluted 1:500) or rat polyclonal antibodies (MR4) to the P. falciparum endoplasmic reticulum marker BiP (32) at 37 C with gentle shaking for 1 h.#Immuno-gold electron microscopy with cultured parasites revealed nuclear location of Pfhsp and primarily cytoplasmic (probably endoplasmic reticulum) location of Pfgrp#To ascertain RAMA trafficking through the compartments of the secretory pathway, we performed double staining IFA using mouse anti-RAMA-E sera and rabbit antibodies to either ER marker (PfGRP) or Golgi marker (PfERD2) proteins.#To localize PfSP21, we performed co-localization studies with ER marker BiP [30 and [44.#Merged images of PfDYN2 (green) and the ER PfBIP (red, df), the apicoplast PfACP (red, gi) and the Golgi apparatus PfERD2 (red, jl).#The cellular localization of Pfdyn1 was compared with the known ER-resident protein, PfGRP, with a rat polyclonal anti-PfGRP antibody to identify the endoplasmic reticular structure inside the parasite cytoplasm#Nup100 localizes in close proximity to BiP, a marker for the ER (Kumar et al., 1991) and does not overlap with DAPI confirming that it defines the outer limits of the nucleus (Fig. 2B).#Extensive colocalization of PM V and BiP was observed (Fig. 5C). In contrast, PM V did not colocalize with the Golgi marker ERD2 (Fig. 5D), which is distributed in small, juxtanuclear foci as previously described#Next, we examined the distribution of PfPRL relative to the ER marker PfBip, and the rhoptry/micronemal protein PfAMA-1.#PfSyn1 (green) again has a peripheral location that is distinct from the ER marker PfBiP (in red) (C). #To confirm that PfCEN3 localizes to centrosomes in the nuclear membrane, parasite ER/nuclear membrane was stained with anti-BiP antibody, which labels an ER resident protein.#Colocalization of Sec13p–GFP (green) with the ER marker BiP (red) in fixed parasites#PfCDS-N3TM–GFP was co-labeled with Bip, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).#Confocal and immunoelectron microscopy analyses of transgenic parasites harboring GFP or HA-tagged PfNT2 demonstrated endoplasmic reticulum localization. This localization was confirmed by colocalization with the endoplasmic reticulum marker PfBiP. #As shown in Fig. 5B, PfSCD-GFP colocalized mostly with PfBiP and PfDSI (disulfide isomerase), two soluble ER markers [41], [43], therefore confirming the ER localization of PfSCD-GFP. In contrast, the GFP-tagged PfSCD protein did not colocalize with ERD2, a known marker of the cis-Golgi [41], [44].#The GFP-PfYkt6.1 compartments were only partially labeled with antibodies against the Golgi marker PfErd2 (B), or the ER marker PfBip (C).

In addition to MSP7, several other proteins have been reported to interact with the MSP1 complex through protein-protein interactions. We investigated expression and distribution of MSP3, MSP6, and MSP9 (ABRA) and a parasitophorous vacuolar protein, SERA-5, in order to examine the consequence of altering the nature of the MSP1 complex.#Both SERA5 and SERA6 are known to localize to the parasitophorous vacuole (1, 2, 23). Double labeling experiments revealed that SERA4 co-localizes with SERA5 (Fig. 7A).

However, in the rare event of capturing arrested invasion, fluorescence of both PfFormin1 and PfRON4 appear to split to form two distinct foci (a ring in three dimensions) either side of the merozoite at the interface with the erythrocyte (Figure3B). This is consistent with their location at the tight junction during merozoite invasion (Figure3; schematic). #Co-localisation IFAs were performed on mature schizont-infected red blood cells and ruptured merozoites using our anti-PfRON4 antisera and antisera against the rhoptry marker proteins RAMA and Pf34 ([Proellocks et al., 2007 and [Topolska et al., 2004). Co-localisation of PfRON4 with both RAMA and Pf34 is observed, with marginally better co-localisation observed with Pf34, a reported rhoptry neck protein (Proellocks et al., 2007). #The primary antibody was a monoclonal antibody that reacts with the P. falciparum rhoptry nick protein Pf225 (green).#IFAs using the anti-PfRON antibodies reveal staining of the apical tip of free merozoite, in close apposition with the rhoptry bulb markers PfRAP1 and PfRAMA, suggesting a rhoptry neck localisation.#immunoelectron microscopy confirms that PfRON4 localizes to the rhoptry neck#No anti-PfnPrx (MCP1) signal was found at the tight junction, visualized by staining with an antibody against the RON4 protein, a well characterized marker of this transient structure (25)"

The fluorescence pattern is more consistent with localized concentrations of the antigen in the cytoplasm. This pattern coupled with PfB0400w's secretory signal sequence suggests that it may be located in cytoplasmic vesicles.

At a later stage, the Ag appears also to infiltrate the spaces between the pseudocytomeres of the developing schizonts, as the plasmalemma forms deep invaginations into the parasite cytoplasm (Fig. 3c), and is subsequently seen localized around the cytomeres, just before the individualization of merozoites (Fig. 34. The ultrastructural localization of LSA-1 was revealed by immunogold labeling of fully mature forms, which showed this protein to be associated with the fluffy or flocculent material present in the PV that surrounds the emerging exo-erythrocytic merozoites (Fig. 3e).

CLAG9 was previously localized exclusively to the bulb of the rhoptry (31). The distribution of CLAG9 predominantly overlaps with that of RALP1 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the apical distribution of RALP1 was clearly distinct from that of the micronemal marker proteins EBA-175 and EBA-181 (19, 53) (Fig. 5C and D).

PfRab11A has a dynamic localisation. (AC) Throughout the erythrocytic stage of parasite development the localisation of PfRab11A changes.

The merged images show co-localisation of the two proteins, giving single dots.

At 1 min post-induction (PI) a single band of fluorescence was detectable spanning the dark nuclear area. Not infrequently ends of these single bands were decorated by two to four bright dots (Fig. 2B-D). At 6 min PI four distinct bands were visible at the nuclear periphery; these often appeared as two pairs of parallel bands, each pair in a separate focal plane (Fig. 2E, F). At 7 min the bands had become elongated and appeared thinner in the middle region (Fig. 2G, H). At the completion of this division these spindles retracted to eight dot-like structures, each closely associated with a ring of fluorescence, which occupied the periphery of the cell (Fig. 2 I, J).

At 1 min post-induction (PI) a single band of fluorescence was detectable spanning the dark nuclear area. Not infrequently ends of these single bands were decorated by two to four bright dots (Fig. 2B-D). At 6 min PI four distinct bands were visible at the nuclear periphery; these often appeared as two pairs of parallel bands, each pair in a separate focal plane (Fig. 2E, F). At 7 min the bands had become elongated and appeared thinner in the middle region (Fig. 2G, H). At the completion of this division these spindles retracted to eight dot-like structures, each closely associated with a ring of fluorescence, which occupied the periphery of the cell (Fig. 2 I, J). In cells that were suitably positioned, serial sectioning resolved the peripheral ring of fluorescence into a basket of six to eight elongate bands coiled tightly around the nucleus (Fig. 2 K-P).

In addition, they are localized to the spindle pole and the centrioles, respectively.#Note the gold particles localizing to the spindle poles (NS) of the multiple nuclei (N) and the posterior extremities of the cup-shaped (arrowheads), newly forming, inner membrane cytoskeleton scaffolds (I). In addition, one IMC has been cut tangentially through the base of the cone, showing gold particles along its length (parallel arrows in the lower right corner). Sexual development was studied across four coccidian species: T. gondii, E acervulina, E. tenella, and E. maxima. They developed in similar manners and varied only in size and the number of gametes formed. Therefore, coccidian sexual development will be represented in a combined description without differentiating between the species.#Figure 1.  TgMORN1 is a component of the basal complex and forms rings and fibers when ectopically expressed in E. coli.#Using a MORN1 antibody, which highlights the basal complex (Gubbels et al., 2006), the basal localization of YFP–IMC11 is supported (Fig. S9D), but the poor YFP signal again did not permit a firm colocalization assignment."

However, this heterogeneity neither changed reactivity in the indirect fluorescence antibody test nor immunoblotting to T. gondii tachyzoites.#Staining for the dense granules was obtained by using anti-GRA3 antibodies (Leriche and Dubremetz, 1991), an anti-MIC3 was used to detect the micronemes (Achbarou et al., 1991) and an anti-ROP2 for the rhoptries (Fig. 6).#(three antigenically cross-reacting rhoptry proteins)#The evacuoles are identified by ROP2 staining (arrow)#Antisera prepared against whole parasites or a parasite fraction enriched in rhoptries and dense granules reacted with the PVM in these permeabilized cells, indicating that parasite-encoded antigens were exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the PVM.#For all of these genes, labelling of TgMIC10 (red) and TgROP2/3/4 (blue) demonstrates at least partial colocalization with both rhoptry and microneme markers (cf. arrow heads for 8.m00177 in Fig. 2).#OP2-HA was expressed in T. gondii. When localized with anti-HA antibody, ROP2-HA precisely co-localized with the mature rhoptry compartment, as detected with anti-ROP2 polyclonal antibody.#However, by double labelling using anti-ROP2,3,4 and anti-NTPases it was shown that NTPases are located in a distinct structure located between the nucleus and the rhoptries (Fig. 1h).#Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron-microscopy showed that the antibody reacted with an antigen localized in the rhoptries, 1 of the organelles of the apical complex of the zoites involved in host cell invasion.#TgTwinScan_2359-YFP and TgTwinScan_2661-YFP (both in green) localize to the apical end of extracellular tachyzoites with partial overlap with the rhoptries (ROP2, red) and micronemes (AMA1, red).#Catalase (green channel) does not colocalize with various parasite organelles by IFA. Micronemes (a), rhoptries (c), and dense granules (e) (all in the red channel) are labeled with monoclonal mouse antibodies to organellar proteins.#No clear overlap between TgPP2C (green) and rhoptry resident proteins (Rhop2-3-4, red) was observed indicating that the anti-TgPP2C antibodies did not detect the rhoptry PP2C-hn (Fig. 2A, lower panel).#Similar colocalization of toxopain-1 and ROP2 to the rhoptries was also observed using the ROP2 polyclonal antibodies (data not shown). #Section through a mature schizont double labelled with anti-ROP2-4 (red) and anti-NTPase (green) showing the rhoptry protein was in separate granules from the dense granule protein (from Ferguson et al., 1999a).#ROP proteins were discharged both into the forming parasitophorous vacuole and into numerous small, satellite vesicles that often extended in clusters out away from the vacuole (Figure 1A).#B.

(B,C) Developing and enlarging schizonts, which still have the central refractile body and no merozoite differentiation, do not stain. (D) In maturing schizonts, as merozoites bud from the schizont, EtMIC4 staining is seen in the central region and around the edge, where the merozoite tips are located. (E) As the schizont reaches bursting point, staining is clearly associated with the apical tips of the merozoites. ...

In both cases, the schizonts did not stain with anti-MORN1, although in certain samples, light staining of the nuclear pole was visible (Fig. 3A). … Sexual development was studied across four coccidian species: T. gondii, E acervulina, E. tenella, and E. maxima. They developed in similar manners and varied only in size and the number of gametes formed. Therefore, coccidian sexual development will be represented in a combined description without differentiating between the species."
