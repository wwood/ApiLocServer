<h2>Which gene do you mean?</h2>
<p>I found genes by that name in these species:</p>

<ul>
<% @codes.each do |code| %>
<li><%= code.species.name %> <%= code_name_annotation code %> <%= code.id %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
<% else %>
<h2>Error</h2>
I couldn't find any gene called '<%= @gene_id %>'. If that is an abbreviation for a species, then try using all lower-case letters. The EuPathDB gene identifier would be best. If you think this is a mistake in ApiLoc, please contact us as we are eager for feedback.
